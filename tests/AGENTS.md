# Playwright Tests (Project Conventions)

- Use `tests/fixtures.ts` (`import { test, expect } from './fixtures'`).
- Tag unauthenticated coverage with `@unauth` (tests or describes). Auth tests are the default.
- Do not set `storageState` in tests. Auth is handled by the Playwright project and `tests/global.setup.ts`.
- Prefer explicit, user-visible assertions (URL, title, headings, key UI).
- Keep tests independent; no shared state across tests.
- Use stable selectors and roles; avoid brittle text where possible.
- Keep specs focused: one behavior per test, minimal setup.

Run: `pnpm test` or `pnpm test tests/<file>.spec.ts`
