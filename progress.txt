# Codebase Patterns
- When introducing foreign-keyed ownership fields tied to Clerk identity, resolve `Users` by `clerkUserId` inside API routes and create the local user row on demand with unique-constraint race protection before writing the dependent record.
- For owner-restricted writes, resolve the authenticated local user before authorization and gate on `Events.ownerId`; Clerk metadata (`role=admin` or `isAdmin=true`) is the admin bypass.
- RSVP write routes should validate `Events` existence and time-window before touching `Rsvps`, and return structured 4xx payloads (`code`/`error`/`message`/`eventId`) for deterministic client and E2E handling.

## Iteration Notes
## [2026-02-14 21:28:30 CET] - US-001
- Added event ownership support by introducing `Events.ownerId` as a `Users.id` foreign key in Astro DB schema.
- Updated `/api/events/create` to ensure the authenticated Clerk user is present in local `Users`, then persist `ownerId` on new events.
- Files changed: `db/config.ts`, `src/pages/api/events/create.ts`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Astro DB schema evolution is handled directly in `db/config.ts`; there is no separate checked-in SQL migration directory in this repo.
    - For auth-backed writes, API routes should not assume local `Users` rows already exist even for signed-in users.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - Clerk-authenticated routes can race on first-time local user creation; guard inserts by tolerating `UNIQUE constraint` errors and re-querying.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `src/pages/api/events/create.ts` now owns event ownership assignment and is the reference path for future edit-authorization checks.

## [2026-02-15 14:50:51 CET] - US-002
- Enforced owner/admin authorization in `/api/events/update` by syncing the authenticated local user, checking Clerk admin metadata, and rejecting unauthorized edits with `403`.
- Added Playwright coverage for non-owner edit rejection by creating an event with a different `ownerId` and asserting `/api/events/update` returns forbidden.
- Extended test seeding helpers to support explicit event ownership (`ownerId`) for auth-sensitive scenarios.
- Files changed: `src/pages/api/events/update.ts`, `src/pages/api/test/seed.ts`, `tests/helpers/api-helpers.ts`, `tests/event-edit.spec.ts`, `tests/AGENTS.md`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Ownership authorization must be enforced in API routes even when UI hides edit actions.
    - Seed helpers that expose ownership fields make auth edge-case E2E tests deterministic.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - Authenticated Clerk sessions can exist before local `Users` rows; sync local users before ownership checks.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `tests/event-edit.spec.ts` now contains a direct non-owner forbidden-path assertion for `/api/events/update`.

## [2026-02-15 15:41:31 CET] - US-003
- Implemented server-side RSVP target validation in `/api/rsvp` by checking event existence and rejecting past-event submissions before any RSVP insert/update.
- Added structured error responses for invalid RSVP targets: `EVENT_NOT_FOUND` (404) and `EVENT_CLOSED` (409), each including `eventId`.
- Added Playwright API tests covering unknown-event and past-event RSVP rejection paths for authenticated users.
- Files changed: `src/pages/api/rsvp.ts`, `tests/rsvp-api.spec.ts`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - RSVP APIs should return machine-readable 4xx payloads so both UI scripts and Playwright API assertions can reliably branch on error type.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - Authenticated E2E calls to `/api/rsvp` still depend on a local `Users` row; ensure the test user is synced before asserting downstream event-state validation.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `tests/rsvp-api.spec.ts` is now the primary coverage for RSVP invalid-target behavior at the API layer.
